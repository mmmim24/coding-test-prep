# Linked List Implementation

## C++

```bash
g++ solution.cpp
./a.out
```

## Java

```bash
# recommended

# this compiles the java file 
# into bytecode DoublyLinkedList.class
# then runs the bytecode
javac DoublyLinkedList.java
java DoublyLinkedList

# not recommended

# Running java DoublyLinkedList.java may work in some environments 
# because modern Java versions (Java 11 and later) support 
# single-file source-code execution. This feature allows you 
# to run a .java file directly with java without explicitly compiling it first:

# The java command implicitly compiles DoublyLinkedList.java
# to bytecode in memory and executes the main method.
java DoublyLinkedList.java

# or you can run the solution
# which includes modular code
javac solution.java
java Solution
```

## Python

```bash
python3 solution.py
```
